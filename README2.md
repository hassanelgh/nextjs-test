### Purpose of the Launchpad

The Launchpad serves as a centralized interface for accessing multiple applications. It simplifies navigation by presenting relevant applications based on the user’s role and streamlining access to critical notifications and user account management.

### Role-Based Application Display

Role-based access ensures that users only see applications they are authorized to access. This enhances security and usability by reducing clutter and minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive tools or data.
